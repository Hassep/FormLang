Phillip,

The project idea seems interesting; however: 
  - it is too simple; consider all possible outcomes when the player is at the
    plate: a strike, a ball, ball hits player, player hits ball; what things
    reset the counts? what things modify the DFA states without producing outs?


Peace,
